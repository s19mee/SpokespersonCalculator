Spokesperson Calculator written with C#

One of my first project was to start C#. 
My purpose in sharing it with you is that if someone wants to start learning C#, this calculator can be a good idea for learning.

This Windows Form calculator is able to perform calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, radical, sine, cosine, and tan, as well as talk to you during the operation.
